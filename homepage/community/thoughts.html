                    <h2>REVEALING TRUTHS</h2>
                    <p>Over the course of 5 months I held workshops and talked with my peers about how crafting traditions have influenced our lives.</p>
                    <p>It’s common to have a family member who does a craft. A resounding 92% of survey participants have a family member who knows how to sew. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>“My Great Grandma taught me how to crochet when she was like- almost 100, which is really crazy, actually. Umm.. and she also taught me how to sew. How to hand sew and then use the sewing machine. Cuz that's kind of like all she did all day, she was really good at crocheting blankets and quilting and sewing and making pillowcases and stuff. And my mom taught me the rest.” </h4><p>says Amelia, a fellow senior in Graphic Design at VCU.</p>
                    <p>A pillowcase was the first thing I sewed as well. She recalls, </p><h4>“I was probably like seven or eight and she had us make tooth fairy pillows for the tooth fairy, where it had like a little pocket for your tooth. And then there would be a quarter in the pocket. And that was great.”</h4>
                    <p>Pillowcases are a first sewing project for many as it teaches the basics of sewing straight lines, turning out corners, and an understanding of right and wrong sides.
                    </p>
                    <p>Combined, Grandmothers and Mothers lead the charge by 79% on teaching relatives to sew.</p>
                    <p>My grandmother’s house is filled with crocheted doilies that she and my mom have made throughout their lives. Doilies today can be learned by using a crochet chart but my mom didn’t learn from a chart, my grandma would show my mom what stitches to combine in the manner of ‘do a treble crochet, do a double crochet’.</p>
                   <h4>“That lowkey seems like a much less like, intimidating way to learn something about it than to like watch a youtube video or like checking a pattern, to have someone be like ‘just do this now'”</h4><p> says Amelia.</p> 
                    
                    <p>While most participants in the survey were taught how to sew by a family member, those who did not learn from a family member mostly learned at school or were self taught.</p>
                    <p>It’s important to note that among those who know how to sew, a majority (32%) don't actively sew. While conducting my Quilt Block Workshops, I found that the majority of those who attended the workshops hadn’t sewn recently, but as the sessions progressed it came back to them like riding a bike. As the survey and the workshops were conducted in the VCUArts community, many take up other disciplines.</p>
                    <p>Aside from sewing, the most popular crafts that survey respondents partake in were Paper & Bookarts, Printing & Dyeing, Knitting & Crochet, Woodworking, and Ceramics.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to crafts in general, school or classes are the #1 teacher.</p>
                    <h5>“Do I craft? YES! I love craft, craft is me. We are two in one.” </h5><p>says Jessica, a VCU Craft and Material Studies Alum who focused in clay and fiber. She took every clay class she could once except for one,</p>
                    <h5>“I did take tableware, which is a ceramics class about making utilitarian kinds of pots for the table. Plates, bowls, cups, beautiful. I took that class twice. I like it a lot because the teacher asks really thought provoking questions where you may have not thought about the rim of a plate before. Or the surface area of the bottom of a bowl and what that means for the object.”</h5>
                    <p>Believe it or not, Jessica gained a love for ceramics after coming to college.</p> <h5>“I took a high school art’s class that was 3D art and we did paper, wire, and clay. But I did very little clay. I did very physical, 3D kind of.. Art over drawing or painting.</h5>
                    <h5>So that was the first introduction I had to it. I applied to art school kind of on a whim and decided to do craft because my siblings said ‘this looks kind of interesting’ and I thought ‘OKAY!’, cuz’ I had no idea what I wanted to do! And then once I got into clay, which was the first intro I took, mind was blowwwn. I was a new person, and I was like ‘I cannot imagine doing anything else.’”</h5>
                    <p>Two things Jessica and I have in common are being younger siblings, and the daughters of hard working immigrants. I often wonder if being the youngest made my parents less worried about me pursuing a career in the arts. They weren’t too surprised though, because my teachers would always show them my art during parent teacher conferences.</p>
                    <p>Elementary school art classes are often the first introduction of traditional art for kids in America.</p>
                    <h5>“So since I'm first gen and my parents immigrated here, I was always interested in art stuff but they were always like ‘yeah that's a hobby girllll go find your real profession.’</h5>
                    <h5>So I wasn't really given opportunities to explore that outside of school, other than the art class in elementary school and middle school. In high school I took actual art classes but it was still never something I took seriously as a profession or like a career until I applied.</h5>
                    <h5>I think my parents mentality, going through what they went through, getting over here and then having your first kid here choose such a scary thing to you, to them that must be terrifying and I understand.”</h5>
                    <p>It's important to understand that Jessica’s artistic journey is informed by her background,</p> <h5>“I think my parents being Bolivians, and South America in general, that kind of imagery is incorporated a lot in my practice. The mountains, the dirt, the frickin llamas.”</h5>
                    <h5>“I think my grandparents, I heard of them doing a lot of fiber arts mostly out of necessity, but I never really got to meet them…but thinking about those connections… I think about my grandparents a lot. Because I don't really know them, and what it means for them to have been crafting out of necessity, but also adornment is the core question of what craft is. So I’m always drawing back connections to my grandparents in craft and like ancestry.”</h5>
                    <p>The reason why I started this project in the first place was because I spend a lot of time sewing with my mom and talking through our family history. As a kid, my mom taught me how to sew and later on she taught my sister and I how to crochet. My mother was taught by my grandmother and so on. Earlier generations of my mom’s side of the family sewed and crocheted as trade. They were tailors and seamstresses that created goods out of their homes in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, for a living. Every now and then my mom shows me a technique that one of her family member’s showed her and although I learn a great deal in school and online, I attribute most of my sewing skills to my mother.</p>
                    <p>Contrastingly, 64.28% of participants identified that they are not influenced by a familial sewing tradition. In conversation on a smaller basis though, it seems as though having a family member who does a craft does add to creativity.</p>
                    <p>Jessica’s father works in construction which led him to woodworking as a hobby.</p> <h5>“He’s like kind of good at it, not gonna lie, like furniture design and stuff…But just knowing my dad- like I call him a craftsperson and he doesn’t really adopt that for himself. He sees himself more of just like, I don't know like a worker and so I think that's interesting. And I think my grandparents probably would have had the same language around craft, not really seeing it as an artistic practice.”</h5>
                    <p>One similarity between Amelia, Jessica, and I, is that we all have relatives who do skilled work in their crafts, but don’t adopt the title of artist or craftsperson to themselves.</p>
                    <p>My grandmother on my dad’s side would make quilts and send them to us over the years. For Black women in the rural south, quilting groups were essential for organising and providing a conversation place in the mid to late 1900’s. Many quilts made in quilting groups in my grandmother’s town ended up in the Arkansas Old State House. But the ones that my grandmother made over the years for my dad, his brothers, and eventually for me, are still around. She doesn’t see them as art, but as a way to stay warm.</p>
                    <p>Amelia recalls of her Great Grandmother,</p> <h4>“The most prominent things I remember about my Great Grandma were sewing, crocheting, and like chopping vegetables for dinner. Cause that's kind of like, all of her Grandkids and Great Grandkids, that's kind of what we all did together. She taught the boys how to sew too.”</h4>
                    <p>They see themselves as our Parents, Grandparents, and Great Grandparents who happen to make things on the side.</p>
                    <p>There is a schism as old as time between the words ‘craft’ and ‘art’ which typically favors art and cheapens craft. Because crafts are things that are usually made with a utilitarian purpose, the word has been separated from art over time. Which is funny because you can use many traditional crafts like sewing, crochet, woodworking, and ceramics to make art. Since these processes are largely skill based, it’s important that we become more inclusive with the word art and include a larger variety of mediums within the umbrella.</p>
                    <p>In my eyes, craft is a descriptor for the type of work you're doing in order to achieve an art piece.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, I want to reiterate how important school is to the development of artists. After initially learning a craft 24.2%  of survey respondents continued to learn new skills at school.</p>
                    <p>For Jessica, access to the studio resources was one of the most important parts of learning while at school,</p> <h5>“I’ve definitely taken my time in school very seriously, because I realized how much of a privilege it is for me specifically to be able to go into craft. And so taking advantage of all the opportunities and materials possible is definitely something that I've tried to do.”</h5>
                    <h5>So in clay i've taken every clay class I could take. Huge hand building, advanced wheel- to use a pottery wheel is so expensive, and then glaze tech for formulation-that’s also not something you get to do all the time. In that class you learn about the kilns and that’s knowledge.</h5>
                    <h5>I think knowledge is so, so important.”</h5>
                    <p>Coming into VCU, I already knew how to sew, knit, and crochet which felt like enough skills to accomplish my crazy ideas. But I ended up learning so many more techniques with the resources provided to me. My hope is that future generations will be encouraged to participate in art the way that my peers and I were encouraged.</p>

                    <h3>Contributions from survey respondents and community members about their familial crafting traditions!</h3>
                    <p>"My grandmother on my dads side has always been an incredible embroiderer in the traditional Bulgarian cross stitch style, which always has a ton of culture and symbolism in it displayed in the stitching!"</p>
                    <p>"tatreez! traditional Palestinian embroidery"</p>
                    <p>"A lot of the sewing that my family partakes in is for repairs, but alternatively, there is a lot of active sewing in regards to hair for protective styles. I was always interested in the rounded needle, which helps get into braided hair easier."</p>
                    <p>"i think this is a common tradition — but sharing anyways! some of my favorite quilts are made by the women in my family for momentous (happy or sad) occasions, like the quilt my grandma made for my mom when she went off to college. i also made my sister and her wife a quilt for their wedding. my best friend made me a quilt when my mom died. i think it's one of the most heartfelt gifts you can receive."</p>
                    <p>"Quilting!! My grandpa made tons of quilts with his huge quilting machine but I never learned how to use it because he recently passed away"</p>
                    <p>"My maternal side is directly descended from the Appalachian people who lived in the Shenandoah Valley before it was established as a national park! A major part of their culture was hand sewing, out of necessity and also for expression. Women would sew clothing, bedding, toys, etc. There was also a super unique tradition specific to this area of multiple women working together to create quilts for the community. Sewing as a community practice is so inspiring to me :)"</p>
                    <p>"Many of my aunts sewed and crocheted to make a living and help support their families. I sew for enjoyment and a love for making things through sewing."</p>
                    <p>"My family did a lot of Korean origami when I was younger. Here is a <a href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/traditional-origami-paper-folding-in-korea-2540682" target="_blank">link</a> to a Korean "origami" simple explanation"</p>
