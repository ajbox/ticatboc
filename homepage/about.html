                <p>Traditions in Craft and the Breaking of Cycles is a culmination of my research/inquires into my own familial tradition of craft, as well as an opportunity to have conversations with my peers about how circumstances affect the passing down of crafts.</p>
                <p>The project manifests in two parts: A survey about sewing traditions that was conducted in the VCU Arts community, and a quilt that was made during multiple Quilt Block Workshops held in Richmond,VA. 
                </p>
                <p>The survey results are intended to aid in our understanding of whether or not sewing has held up as a tradition in the current ultra consumerist and digital age. 
                </p>
                <p>The workshops served as a modern day quilting circle, presenting the opportunity for my peers to learn or become better at sewing, while also providing a place for conversation around current events.
                </p>
                <p>I talked with some of the participants in the workshop about crafting traditions in general and how these traditions may or may not have been passed down to them. We covered various topics that affect making such as family dynamics, economic stance, and cultural significance. These conversations can be viewed on the “Thoughts from the Community” page. </p>
